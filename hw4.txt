Output



This graph is unimodal, with its highest pick at 0-20% of breast cancer rate. It seems to be skewed to the right as there are higher frequencies in lower categories than the higher categories. 


This graph is unimodal, with its highest pick at 0-1% of HIV rate. It seems to be skewed to the right as there are higher frequencies in lower categories than the higher categories. 


This graph is unimodal, with its highest pick at the median of 55-60% employment rate. It seems to be a symmetric distribution as there are lower frequencies in lower and higher categories. 


This graph plots the breast cancer rate vs. HIV rate for people with a high suicide rate. It shows that people with breast cancer are not infected with HIV.
